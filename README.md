# Noise-Adaption-Layer
This is the Pytorch implementation of paper--[Training deep neural-networks using a noise adaptation layer](https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=Sk5qglwSl), but not official.

## Requirements
<pre>
Python 3.7
Pytorch 1.8.0
pandas
numpy
</pre>

## Dataset
There are three datasets and I perturb the noise in `data_utils.py` file.If your are interested in perturbing noise in dataset, you could check `noise.py`.

## How to run it?
You could check the shell script and you will get to know how it could work.
